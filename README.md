# C-Programming

Hello World! 

Welcome to your coding journey, new CS People! 

Don't forget to keep your hunger for your new and exciting journey of coding. But, first, why not googling a bit about **Why you should learn C programming** while big sharks are already eating everything with Python or other fancy languages! 

In this repository, I have attempted to cover various C programming problems and their solutions. Here, I've also provided the necessary books for learning this language, especially **E. Balagurusamy - Programming in ANSI C-McGraw Hill Education (India) (2016)**. Lastly, I also added some assignments so that after finishing all the problems, anyone can verify the learning by doing the assignment.

A possible Learning flow can be:

Learning from [Anisul Islam Sir's C Programming Tutorial](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgH5QX0i9K3pCMBZcul1fta6UivHDbXvz&si=k1pWb7yLCK8zqmaL), then practicing the given problems in this repo, while learning from the video tutorial and practicing the problems, anyone willing to learn better and dive deeper is motivated to read [E. Balagurusamy - Programming in ANSI C-McGraw Hill Education (India) (2016)](https://github.com/1000yearsoldguy/C-Programming/blob/e09e8a728a2ace4797759ec945818362db534517/Books%20for%20C/E.%20Balagurusamy%20-%20Programming%20in%20ANSI%20C-McGraw%20Hill%20Education%20(India)%20(2016)%20%23book.pdf) while going through the video tutorials and solving the problems.
